# OpenCV Examples


## color_tracker:

A python implementation for contour detection and drawing in a video stream.
The code uses OpenCV (cv2) to perform operations such as color space conversion, contour detection, and drawing. The code opens a video capture object on the specified channel and continues to read frames until the stream runs out of frames or the user presses 'q' on the keyboard. At each iteration, the code detects contours in the frame, draws them on the frame, and displays the output.
