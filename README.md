# OpenCV Examples


## Color tracker:

A Python implementation for detecting colors in a video stream. Uses OpenCV (cv2) for tasks such as color space conversion, contour detection, and drawing. Opens a video capture object and reads frames until the stream ends or the user presses "q". At each iteration, it detects colors and contours, draws them on the frame, and displays the output.
